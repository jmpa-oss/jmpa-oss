This is a personal GitHub organization for me to play around with projects.

**Core Ideas:**
* Using `GitHub Actions` for CI/CD.
* Using a personal GitHub organization to have private projects with private secrets.
* Any projects that need to be deployed are deployed to a personal AWS account.
* Custom `GitHub Actions` can be written to handle "standard" workflow.
  * (i.e. posting to Slack, linting, templating, etc.)
* Writing most things myself, unless an offical "thing" is provided.
  * (i.e. like a `GitHub Action` for authing to an AWS account).
