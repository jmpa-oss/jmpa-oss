# `jmpa-oss`

(`J`ust `M`e `P`laying `A`round)

This is a personal GitHub organization for me to play around with projects.

> [Click here to see a list of the public projects.](https://github.com/jmpa-oss?q=&type=public&language=&sort=)

**The _Idea_:**

⚫ Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

🟠 Use a personal GitHub organization to have private projects with private secrets.

🔵 Any projects that need to be deployed are deployed to a personal AWS account.

🟣 Custom `GitHub Actions` can be written to handle "standard" workflow.

> (i.e. posting to Slack, linting, templating, etc.)

🟢 Writing most things myself, unless an offical "thing" is provided.
> (i.e. like a `GitHub Action` for authing to an AWS account)
