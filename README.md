This is a personal GitHub organization for me to play around with projects.

Features:
* GitHub Actions used for CI/CD.
* Projects that need to be deployed, are deployed to a personal AWS account.
* Able to write custom GitHub Actions to handle "standard" workflow (eg. posting to Slack, linting, etc)
