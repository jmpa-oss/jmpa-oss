# `jmpa-oss`

(`J`ust `M`e `P`laying `A`round)

This is a personal GitHub organization for me to play around with projects.

> [Click here to see a list of the public projects.](https://github.com/jmpa-oss?q=&type=public&language=&sort=)

**The _Idea_:**

```diff
+ Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
- Use a personal GitHub organization to have private projects with private secrets.
! Any projects that need to be deployed are deployed to a personal AWS account.
# Custom `GitHub Actions` can be written to handle "standard" workflow (i.e. posting to Slack, linting, templating, etc.)
@@ Writing most things myself, unless an offical "thing" is provided (i.e. like a `GitHub Action` for authing to an AWS account).
```
